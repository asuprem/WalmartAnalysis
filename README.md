# WalmartAnalysis
Analysis of Walmart data during Columbia Hackathon

All files in `clustered` folder: These are used during the import process in `importWorker`

`importWorker.m`: This imports all the necessary files and performs some analyses on them:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Covariance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Product correlation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Correlation plotting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Sales by day
  
 This data is used to define a prediction model presented in `hackathon.pdf`
 
 
 (Note: To use, file path in `importWorker.m` should be changed to wherever the `clustered` folder is.
